# Ruby Type Error: NoMethodError in Setter Method

This repository demonstrates a common Ruby error: a `NoMethodError` arising from a lack of type checking within a setter method. The bug occurs when a method is called on an instance variable that does not support that specific method based on its current data type.

The `bug.rb` file contains the buggy code, showing the error scenario.  The `bugSolution.rb` file provides a corrected version that addresses the issue with type checking.
